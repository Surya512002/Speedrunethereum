Checkpoint 0: 📦 Environment 📚

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

         Node (>= v20.18.3)
         Yarn (v1 or v2+)
         Git

Then download the challenge to your computer and install dependencies by running:

bash
    npx create-eth@1.0.2 -e challenge-dex challenge-dex
    cd challenge-dex

in the same terminal, start your local network (a blockchain emulator in your computer):

bash
    yarn chain

in a second terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract (locally):

bash
      cd challenge-dex
      yarn deploy

in a third terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

bash
      cd challenge-dex
      yarn start

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

👩‍💻 Rerun yarn deploy --reset whenever you want to deploy new contracts to the frontend, update your current contracts with changes, or re-deploy it to get a fresh contract address.
