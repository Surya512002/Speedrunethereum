           cd challenge-tokenization

in the same terminal, start your local network (a blockchain emulator in your computer):

           yarn chain

in a second terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract (locally):

       cd challenge-tokenization
       yarn deploy

in a third terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

      cd challenge-tokenization
      yarn start
