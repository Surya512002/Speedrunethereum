Checkpoint 0: 📦 Environment 📚
Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

Node (>= v20.18.3)
Yarn (v1 or v2+)
Git
Then download the challenge to your computer and install dependencies by running:
           npx create-eth@1.0.5 -e challenge-tokenization challenge-tokenization
          
           cd challenge-tokenization

in the same terminal, start your local network (a blockchain emulator in your computer):

           yarn chain

in a second terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract (locally):

           cd challenge-tokenization
           yarn deploy

in a third terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

           cd challenge-tokenization
           yarn start

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

Checkpoint 1: ⛽️ Gas & Wallets 👛
⛽️ Gas is the tiny fee that powers your transactions, like postage for the blockchain. Grab test funds from the faucet so you can interact onchain.


gas&wallet

🦊 At first, don't connect MetaMask. If you are already connected, click Disconnect:

🔥 We'll use burner wallets on localhost. They're disposable wallets that auto-sign transactions so you can keep building.

👛 Explore burner wallets in 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2: open an incognito window and visit http://localhost:3000. 
    You'll see a totally new address in the top-right. 
    Copy it and send test funds from your first window using the Faucet button (bottom-left):

👨🏻‍🚒 When you close the incognito window, that account is gone forever. Burner wallets are perfect for local dev; you'll switch to a permanent wallet on public networks.

Checkpoint 2: 🖨 Minting
🦓 In this challenge we will be minting (or creating) collectible Buffalo, Zebra and Rhino NFTs. Their metadata is stored on IPFS. 
These won't feign any real value but what price can you put on your own understanding of intricate blockchain ownership designs? Face it, it's priceless!


✏️ Time to create something new. Click MINT NFT in the My NFTs tab to mint an ERC-721 token; your unique, onchain collectible.

    👀 You should see your NFTs start to show up:

👛 Open an incognito window and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

🎟 Try a transfer! Send a token to the incognito window address using the UI:

👛 Try to mint a token from the incognito window

Can you mint a token with no funds in this address? You might need to grab funds from the faucet to pay for the gas.

🕵🏻‍♂️ Inspect the Debug Contracts tab to figure out what address is the owner of a specific token (ownerOf(tokenId)) in YourCollectible.

🔏 You can also check out your smart contract YourCollectible.sol in packages/hardhat/contracts.

💼 Take a quick look at your deploy script 01_deploy_your_collectible.ts in packages/hardhat/deploy.
