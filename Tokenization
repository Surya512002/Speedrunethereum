Checkpoint 0: 📦 Environment 📚
Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

Node (>= v20.18.3)
Yarn (v1 or v2+)
Git
Then download the challenge to your computer and install dependencies by running:
           npx create-eth@1.0.5 -e challenge-tokenization challenge-tokenization
          
           cd challenge-tokenization

in the same terminal, start your local network (a blockchain emulator in your computer):

           yarn chain

in a second terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract (locally):

           cd challenge-tokenization
           yarn deploy

in a third terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

           cd challenge-tokenization
           yarn start

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

Checkpoint 1: ⛽️ Gas & Wallets 👛
⛽️ Gas is the tiny fee that powers your transactions, like postage for the blockchain. Grab test funds from the faucet so you can interact onchain.

🦊 At first, don't connect MetaMask. If you are already connected, click Disconnect:

🔥 We'll use burner wallets on localhost. They're disposable wallets that auto-sign transactions so you can keep building.

👛 Explore burner wallets in 🏗 Scaffold-ETH 2: open an incognito window and visit http://localhost:3000. 
    You'll see a totally new address in the top-right. 
    Copy it and send test funds from your first window using the Faucet button (bottom-left):

👨🏻‍🚒 When you close the incognito window, that account is gone forever. Burner wallets are perfect for local dev; you'll switch to a permanent wallet on public networks.
